        Most of this information isn't new or not available. It is however
        information that is often spread out over multiple locations and/or
        buried in between other information and easily overlooked. Just like my
        Firefly guide (not available due to lost forums) this is not a guide aiming at providing in depth information.
        It is an attempt at providing a comprehensive overview with pointers
        for people to start with.<br>

        <strong>Setting up EVE</strong><br>
        <br>

            <li><a href=

            Unfucking your overview</a>: You probably already have done this
            but it can't be stressed enough. Having a well setup overview will
            save your ass.</li>

            <li>The interface of EVE is completely customizable, as a example
            i'll show you <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YjU155y.png">my eve
            setup</a>.</li>

            <li style="list-style: none">Since I have a dual screen setup I
            decided to make use of that, the chat channels are actually sitting
            on my second screen. I can highly recommend running eve in windowed
            mode, it gives you much easier access to out of game resources and
            if you have multiple screens allows for things like I showed in the
            screenshot. This is what works for me, I know plenty of people who
            have their screens organized in a completely different manner that
            works perfectly for them. What is important to remember though is
            that you want certain information to be easily accessible and other
            stuff to stay out of the way during critical moments.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <strong>Coalition/Alliance/Corp communication</strong><br>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Q9IBj7z.jpg">Jabber</a>: This is
            essential if you want to be quickly informed of fleets going
            up.</li>

            <li style="list-style: none">You don't need to be active in any
            chat channels, as long as you are logged in you will receive
            'pings' which will alert you of stuff that is going down.</li>

            <li><a href=
            "https://github.com/bravecollective/mumble/wiki">Mumble</a>: You
            don't have to be active on mumble all the time, but if you are
            logged in to eve and doing things outside the station it is a good
            idea to be logged in. This allows you to quickly contact people if
            you need help with something.</li>

            <li>Assorted chat channels. For advice you should be in the dojo
            channel.</li>

            <li style="list-style: none">EVERYONE should be in the intel and
            fleet x-up channels and keep an eye on them. If you warped to a
            gate while 20 people reported it camped you'll wish you did.</li>

            <li>Bulletins: In eve in the left menu you'll find a corporation
            button (a planet with 5 stars around it). Click it, go to the
            'alliances' tab and then the 'bulletins' sub tab. A lot of the
            information I list in here can be found there as well and much much
            more. If you didn't do it already you should take some time reading
            through this.</li>

            <li>Alliance mail: Usefull announcements are to be found there, if
            someone sends a mail there you read it carefully.</li>

            <li>Do not, I repeat, do not use corp mail. We have several
            thousand people in the corp, if everyone spammed corp mail for
            every little thing it would turn into a mess very quickly.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <br>
        In general, if you need help with something just ask around, there are
        plenty of people around to answer your question. Also don't be afraid
        to ask people in leadership positions about things. Just be classy
        about what you want to ask and time it right (don't ask about a fitting
        during a roam when the FC is calling targets ;) )<br>

        <strong>Fleet communication</strong><br>
        <a href=
        "https://forums.bravecollective.net/dg/5312dc6d58b70059561968d2">Terms
        you will hear on comms</a><br>
        <br>
        If you are in a fleet and need help/have something tackled/etc you need
        to be as descriptive as possible<br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline">bad:</span><br>

        <ul>
            <li>I am scrammed! (And then ignore any requests for more
            information)</li>

            <li>Warp to me! (Without telling why)</li>

            <li>Need help! (with what?)</li>
        </ul><br>
        <span style=
        "color: green; text-decoration: underline">Good/better:</span><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Scrammed by 2 war targets in &lt;insert ship types&gt;. I fly a
            &lt;insert ship type&gt;</li>

            <li>I have a war target in a &lt;ship type&gt; tackled near
            &lt;gate/planet/asteroid belt/Station&gt;. &lt;number&gt;/no war
            targets in system.</li>
        </ul><br>
        These are just a few examples. In the heat of battle it might be hard
        to type that much information, but any good FC will ask about this
        anyway. So if you are able to give it right away it will actually get
        you support quicker.<br>
        In fact in a lot of cases a fleet will not help someone out that does
        not give information. The reason for that is simple, we don't know if
        there is one ship on your or 50 so blindly warping in more people is
        very likely to get more people killed.<br>

            <li style="list-style: none">I personally like eveeye which is
            awesome for usage during roams and travel, it has a cool feature
            that will automatically center the map to the system where you are
            are currently in. Just a note this map does not work in the ingame
            browser so you have to use it on a second screen. Dotlan is the
            older of the two and has a lot of other information as well.</li>

        </ul><br>
        <br>
        <strong>How to insta-undock</strong><br>

        <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
            <li>Click undock</li>

            <li>DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING, do not activate modules, do not click
            somewhere in space. As long as you do that you cannot be targeted
            for a few seconds.</li>

            <li>Right Click and select a insta undock bookmark (preferable one
            you have made yourself). Alternatively if you have
            people&amp;places open you select the bookmark from there.</li>

            <li>Click warp.</li>

            <li>On land, select a second insta undock slightly farther
            out.</li>

            <li>Warp to the second undock.</li>

            <li>On land, warp to a safe spot/staging pos/whatever.</li>
        </ol><br>
        Why the second warp you ask? Well if the undock is camped they often
        have probes ready and will have you proped out once you land. By going
        to the second undock you will be already in warp again once they land
        and they will not have time to probe you a second time.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Core skills</strong><br>
        Ok, you might already have come across skill plans for new players. But
        that is usually a long list of skills you are told to put in EVEMon and
        just train for.<br>
        Because of that and because they don't seem to offer a direct benefit
        (why should I train for a skill that gives me 5% of something I don't
        even understand yet if I can also train for that shiny cruiser?) I see
        a lot of people neglecting skills that are actually very important.
        Below I have listed several groups of core skills I personally believe
        every player should be aware of and train towards. This doesn't mean
        that you have to stop all other training in favor of these skills! It
        is absolutely fine to train for your frigate and modules you want to
        fit on that frigate first. You should however be aware that the skills
        below benefit <span style="text-decoration: underline">all</span> ships
        you'll fly in EVE, even those you have not trained for yet.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">Engineering</span><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Capacitor Management - <em>You don't want to run out of cap
            during a fight do you?</em></li>

            <li>Capacitor Systems Operation - <em>Increase cap recharge, be
            able to fit boosters.</em></li>

            <li>Weapon Upgrades - <em>Be able to fit those shiny
            guns.</em></li>

            <li>Advanced Weapon Upgrades - <em>Even more shiny.</em></li>

            <li>CPU Management - <em>1% cpu short? Nope not anymore.</em></li>

            <li>Power Grid Management - <em>Never not enough juice to fit
            stuff.</em></li>

            <li>Thermodynamics - <em>Overheat those modules!</em></li>
        </ul>These skills will be useful for <em style=
        "text-decoration: underline">all</em> ships you will fly in EVE. They
        either help you with being able to fit that awesome fit or last longer
        in the field because you have more cap, can overheat your modules,
        etc.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">Navigation</span> in EVE
        you'll survive if you can align faster, move faster and warp faster.
        These skills will help you with that<br>

        <ul>
            <li>Acceleration Control - <em>Be faster!</em></li>

            <li>Evasive Maneuvering - <em>Align (and therefore warp)
            faster!</em></li>

            <li>Navigation - <em>Be even faster!</em></li>

            <li>Warp Drive Operation - <em>Don't drop out of long warps
            anymore.</em></li>
        </ul><br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">Targeting</span> In a lot of
        roams with longer range ships you'll find people not being able to
        target baddies because their targeting can't reach that far, don't be
        that guy ;). As a new player you usually will be flying small fast
        tackle, you'll want to be able to lock that target as soon as possible.
        In other cases you'll find yourself jammed where only holding lock for
        a few more seconds would have gotten you that kill.<br>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>Signature Analysis - <em>lock 'm up fast.</em></li>

            <li>Racial Sensor Compensation - <em>Every race has a specific sort
            visible in the attributes of your ship. Train the one for the ships
            you fly most first.</em></li>

            <li>Long range targeting - <em>lock 'm up from afar.</em></li>

            <li>Target Management - <em>Lock that entire blob!</em></li>
        </ul><br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">Shields</span><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Shield Management - <em>Useful for everyone, even if you don't
            have shield tanked ships. It gives you a slightly better
            buffer.</em></li>

            <li><em>The skills below are for people flying shield tanked
            ships.</em></li>

            <li>EM Shield Compensation</li>

            <li>Kinetic Shield Compensation</li>

            <li>Explosive Shield Compensation</li>

            <li>Thermic Shield Compensation</li>

            <li>Shield Compensation</li>
        </ul><br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">Armor</span><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Hull upgrades - <em>Just like Shield Management, gives you a
            bit of a extra buffer.</em></li>

            <li>Mechanics - <em>One last bit of buffer on structure
            level.</em></li>

            <li><em>The skills below are for people flying armor tanked
            ships.</em></li>

            <li>EM Armor Compensation</li>

            <li>Explosive Armor Compensation</li>

            <li>Thermic Armor Compensation</li>

            <li>Kinetic Armor Compensation</li>

            <li>Armor Layering</li>
        </ul><br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">Gunnery</span> Useful for
        three of the four weapon systems usually found on ships in EVE.<br>

        <ul>
            <li>Motion Prediction - <em>Helps you with pesky targets like our
            undock teacher.</em></li>

            <li>Rapid Firing - <em>Kill them faster.</em></li>

            <li>Sharpshooter - <em>Hit them from farther away.</em></li>

            <li>Trajectory Analysis - <em>Hit them from farther away with
            accuracy.</em></li>

            <li>Surgical Strike - <em>Hit 'm where it hurts.</em></li>

            <li>Controlled Burst - <em>Don't let guns empty your cap (applies
            mostly to lasers and secondly to hybrids).</em></li>
        </ul><br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">Missiles</span> The fourth
        weapon system which has its own set of core skills.<br>

        <ul>
            <li>Missile Bombardment - <em>Hit them from farther away.</em></li>

            <li>Missile Projection - <em>Hit them from even farther
            away.</em></li>

            <li>Rapid launch - <em>Kill them faster.</em></li>

            <li>Target Navigation Prediction - <em>Hit faster moving
            targets.</em></li>

            <li>Warhead upgrades - <em>Hit 'm harder.</em></li>
        </ul><br>
        I am going to wrap it up right here, For a lot of the skills I
        mentioned in these lists there are also advanced versions. I did not
        list them because I believe that at the time you get to those you
        should be able to figure that out for yourself ;) In any case if you
        have trained the listed skills you effectively have created a very good
        starting point for any ship you decide to train towards. It is still a
        smart idea to focus your training on specific ships and weapons,
        however if you have trained the core skills it enables you to cross
        train to pretty much any other race without having to start at zero. So
        for example: You are a mostly Gallente trained pilot with good core
        skills and you decide to switch to caldari frigates (because, crow!)?
        Well as soon as you have trained caldari frigate I you are able to
        outrun, warp, etc that caldari player that just started playing two
        weeks ago.<br>
        <br>
        For bigger/advanced ships these skills are <strong>Essential</strong>!
        Don't even think about stepping into a t2 ship or battleship if you
        don't have these core skills trained to a acceptable level. You
        probably can and many of you will, but that will most likely result in
        you losing costly ships because you were not able to fit or fly them
        properly yet.<br>
